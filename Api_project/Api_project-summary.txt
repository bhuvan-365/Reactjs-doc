Short Description:
This React app fetches a list of posts from an API when the page loads and displays each post as a card. It uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management and side effects.

1.State Setup:
cards state is created to store the list of posts.

2.Fetching Data:
The fetchData function fetches posts from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts, converts the response to JSON, and updates the cards state.

3.useEffect:
useEffect runs fetchData() once when the component mounts (because of the empty dependency array []).

4.Rendering:
The app maps over the cards array and displays each postâ€™s title, body, and user id inside a styled card.

5.Navbar:
The Navbar component is displayed at the top.

6.Summary:
When the app loads, it fetches posts from an API and displays them as cards below the navbar.
